# Todo App Constitution

## Prompt Text

Write a detailed Markdown Constitution for Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App. It must govern spec-driven development, no manual coding, alignment with the Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development, and reusable intelligence. Include rules for using sub-agents (Main Orchestrator coordinates; handoff to Planning/Implementation/Review Agents) and skills (e.g., Spec Refiner for clarity). Emphasize clean Python structure: Use classes for Task and TodoList, in-memory list storage, menu loop with input validation. Output as constitution.md in /specs/.

## Response Text

Created a comprehensive constitution for the In-Memory Python Console App with the following key elements:

1. Core Principles including specification-first development, no manual coding rule, Nine Pillars alignment, reusable intelligence foundation, clean architecture enforcement, and in-memory data integrity.

2. Sub-Agent Coordination rules defining responsibilities for Main Orchestrator, Planning Agent, Implementation Agent, and Review Agent.

3. Skill Integration requirements for Spec Refiner, Code Quality, and Validation skills.

4. Python Structure Requirements specifying class-based architecture with Task and TodoList classes, in-memory storage, menu system, and input validation.

5. Implementation Workflow with phases for Specification Generation, Code Generation, and Validation & Testing.

6. Quality Assurance standards for code quality and testing requirements.

7. Governance rules ensuring compliance with constitutional requirements.
