# Todo App Hackathon - Project Overview

## Project Description
A comprehensive Todo application built as part of a hackathon project. The application will provide core task management functionality with additional features for a complete user experience.

## Core Features
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts and sessions
- **Task Prioritization**: Ability to set priority levels for tasks
- **Due Dates**: Set and track task deadlines
- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks into different categories

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11
- **Package Manager**: UV
- **Database**: SQLite (for hackathon) / PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **API**: RESTful API
- **Frontend**: [To be determined based on hackathon requirements]

## Architecture
The application follows a modular monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns:
- `src/` - Source code for the application
- `specs/` - Feature specifications and requirements
- `tests/` - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- `docs/` - Documentation and guides

## Development Workflow
1. Feature specifications are created in `specs/features/`
2. Code is developed in `src/` following the specifications
3. Tests are written alongside implementation
4. Documentation is updated as features are completed

## Success Criteria
- All core features implemented and tested
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Proper documentation for all features
- Deployable application ready for demonstration
